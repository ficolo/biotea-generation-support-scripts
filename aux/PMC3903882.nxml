In approximately 50% of all malignancies this is achieved by inactivating mutations in the p53 gene. However, in several cancer entities, including melanoma, p53 mutations are rare. It has been recently proposed that tyrosinase related protein 2 (TRP2), a protein involved in melanin synthesis, may act as suppressor of the p53 pathway in melanoma. To scrutinize this notion we analyzed p53 and TRP2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 172 melanoma tissues and did not find any correlation. Furthermore, we applied three different TRP2 shRNAs to five melanoma cell lines and could not observe a target specific effect of the TRP2 knockdown on either p53 expression nor p53 reporter gene activity. Likewise, ectopic expression of TRP2 in a TRP2 negative melanoma cell line had no impact on p53 expression. In conclusion our data suggest that p53 repression critically controlled by TRP2 is not a general event in melanoma.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by research grants from the German Cancer Aid (Melanoma Research Network) and the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF B-193) W&#x000fc;rzburg.

The main biological functions of the transcription factor p53 include regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, senescence, cellular differentiation and DNA repair <xref rid="pone.0087440-Soussi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Due to fast ubiquitination by the E3 ligase MDM2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation, p53 is frequently undetectable in normal cells <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, upon several different stresses, including oncogenic stress or DNA damage, the amount of p53 is increased due to disruption of its degradation <xref rid="pone.0087440-Gembarska1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Munger1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. p53 is a prototypic tumor suppressor and inactivating mutations in the p53 gene are present in approximately half of all human cancers <xref rid="pone.0087440-Soussi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Alternative mechanisms of p53 inactivation include MDM2/4 overexpression <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Gembarska1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, inhibition by viral oncoproteins <xref rid="pone.0087440-Munger1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and loss of p14<sup>ARF</sup>, which binds MDM2 and inhibits its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, the transcriptional activity of p53 can also be impaired on a post-translational level by competition for DNA-binding sites by the p73 isoform &#x00394;Np73 <xref rid="pone.0087440-Grob1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Tuve1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, functional antagonism with the inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein (iASPP) <xref rid="pone.0087440-Grob1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and sequestration in the cytosol by the ubiquitin ligase Parc <xref rid="pone.0087440-Nikolaev1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Moreover, inhibition of p53 expression by tyrosine-related protein 2 (TRP2) has been proposed as a mechanism of p53 restriction <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sendoel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Importantly, all of the aforementioned p53 inactivation mechanisms except inhibition by viral oncoproteins have been described in melanoma cells. This is of particular interest since p53 is frequently expressed in melanoma but inactivating mutations are rarely detectable <xref rid="pone.0087440-Albino1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087440-Daniotti1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, the putative negative p53 regulator TRP2 is a marker of the melanocytic lineage and is expressed in more than 80% of metastatic melanoma lesions <xref rid="pone.0087440-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. TRP2 is transcriptionally regulated by microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and Sox10. TRP2 acts in the melanin synthesis pathway downstream of tyrosinase catalysing the conversion of dopachrome to 5,5-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) <xref rid="pone.0087440-Hearing1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087440-Olivares1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Beside its function in melanin synthesis TRP2 has been proposed to regulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and to function as a pro-survival and anti-apoptotic molecule <xref rid="pone.0087440-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In melanoma cell lines an impaired apoptotic response after radiation or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents was found to be associated with increased expression of TRP2 <xref rid="pone.0087440-Pak1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A possible mechanistic explanation for the anti-apoptotic property of TRP2 has recently been described <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sendoel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Sendoel and co-workers showed in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that secretion of the TRP2 homolog Tyr2 by sensory neurons inhibits p53 expression of germ cells. Moreover, TRP2 knockdown in WM266-4 melanoma cells lead to increased p53 expression sensitizing the cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.</p><p>In this report we further scrutinize a possible role of TRP2 in the regulation of p53 in five different melanoma cell lines and do not find such a relation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Tumor samples from primary and metastatic melanomas were obtained by surgical excision for either therapeutic or diagnostic purposes and had undergone routine histology.

The efficacy of TRP2 knockdown was confirmed by immunoblot; all three shRNAs strongly reduced TRP2 protein expression in melanoma cell lines and the knockdown was most prominent for TRP2-shRNA_#2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To this end, even the most efficient TRP2 knockdown had no effect on p53 expression levels as determined by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0087440-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087440.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Knockdown of TRP2 by shRNA does not affect p53 expression level.</title><p>(A) TRP2 and p53 expression in indicated melanoma cell lines was determined by western blot.

The mean GFP expression was measured by flow cytometry and normalized for the relative number of incorporated pGreenFire copies as determined by real time PCR. As we have shown previously expression levels of p53 do not necessarily correlate with its transcriptional activity suggesting posttranslational inactivation of p53 <xref rid="pone.0087440-Houben1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> which has recently been shown to occur in melanoma e.g. by iASPP <xref rid="pone.0087440-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Accordingly, the M26 and WueMel melanoma cell lines show high p53 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) without any p53 reporter gene activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0087440-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087440.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effects of TRP2 inhibition by shRNA on transcriptional activity of p53.</title><p>Indicated melanoma cell lines were stably transduced with a lentiviral pGreenFire reporter construct encoding for green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of a p53 responsive element (4&#x000d7; <named-content content-type="gene">CGACATGCCCGGGCATGT</named-content>).

However, infection with the TRP2-shRNA_#2 led to increased p53 reporter gene activity in FM88, Mel-U and MelJuso but not in M26 and WueMel 45 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, the results obtained with TRP2-shRNA_#1 and #3 suggest that TRP2 does not play a role in the regulation of p53 while induction of p53 reporter gene activity upon infection with the most effective TRP2-shRNA_#2 in some of the cells would be consistent with an inhibitory function of TRP2 in the p53 pathway. However, shRNAs notoriously exert off target effects <xref rid="pone.0087440-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. To evaluate whether this is the case for TRP2-shRNA_#2 we investigated whether the observed p53 activation can be rescued by re-expression of TRP2. For this experiment we generated a modified TRP2 expression construct coding for an TRP2 mRNA in which the shRNA-binding site is modified by six silent mutations (TRP2in). When TRP2-shRNA_#2 was expressed no downregulation of TRP2 was observed in cells stably expressing the TRP2in construct thus, confirming the insensitivity of the ectopic TRP2in mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g004">Figure 4</xref>) to TRP2-shRNA_#2. Subsequent analysis of p53 transcriptional activity revealed that expression of this shRNA insensitive TRP2in could not revert the increase in p53 reporter gene activity in the presence of shRNA#2, indicating that this is only an off target effect. Moreover, ectopic expression of TRP2 in TRP2-negative WueMel45 melanoma cell line did not repress p53 expression or transcriptional activity as it would be expected when TRP2 functions as negative regulator in the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087440-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0087440-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087440.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Ectopic re-expression of TRP2 does not rescue the p53 activation induced by TRP2-shRNA_#2.</title><p>Indicated melanoma cell lines were stably transduced with a lentiviral p53 reporter construct and a modified TRP2 expression construct coding for TRP2 mRNAs in which the shRNA-binding site is modified by six silent mutations (TRP2in).

However, in several cancer entities, including melanoma p53 mutations are rare <xref rid="pone.0087440-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In these cancers with suppressed wild type p53 function, restoration of p53 activity is regarded as an attractive therapeutic strategy <xref rid="pone.0087440-Cheok1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, for the development of such therapeutic approaches we need to understand the molecular mechanisms restricting p53 function in p53 wild type tumors. The great interest in such mechanisms in melanoma is reflected by several high impact publications during the last 12 months. Lu and co-workers, for example, demonstrated that in melanoma a cyclin B1/cdk1 protein complex phosphorylates iASPP leading to the inhibition of iASPP dimerization, increased nuclear entry of iASPP monomers, as well as binding and inhibition of p53 <xref rid="pone.0087440-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Gembarska and colleagues demonstrated that increased protein levels of the p53 inhibitor MDMX are frequently found in melanomas rendering the p53 tumor suppressor inactive <xref rid="pone.0087440-Gembarska1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A similar mechanism has previously been described for MDM2 <xref rid="pone.0087440-Gembarska1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Muthusamy1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Polsky1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Moreover, p53 function can be suppressed in melanoma due to expression of other p53 family members, including p63 and the N-terminal truncated isoforms &#x00394;Np73 which both act dominant-negative via heterodimerization <xref rid="pone.0087440-Grob1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Tuve1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Matin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Most recently, a synonymous mutation in the BCL2L12 gene was identified in melanoma leading to increased expression of BCL2L12 which binds to p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity <xref rid="pone.0087440-Gartner1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In our study we investigated the role of the TRP2 in p53 regulation prompted by a report of Sendoel and colleagues who identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the TRP2 homolog TYR2 as a protein secreted by neurons and acting paracrine in neighboring germ cells to suppress CEP-1 (p53 homolog in the worm) dependent apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sendoel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using the melanoma cell line WM266-4 which has been established from a lymph node metastasis <xref rid="pone.0087440-Westermark1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Herlyn1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> they demonstrated that such a mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. In this respect they demonstrate that a TRP2 shRNA leads to upregulation of p53 protein levels and that the shRNA mediated TRP2 knockdown increased cisplatin induced apoptosis in the melanoma cell line <xref rid="pone.0087440-Sendoel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To scrutinize to which extent TRP2 is restricting p53 expression and/or p53 function in melanoma we analyzed a large set of melanoma tissues as well as five melanoma cell lines. However, immunohistochemical analysis of the 172 melanoma lesions did not reveal any correlation between TRP2 and p53 expression, arguing against a critical dependency. Furthermore, neither efficient TRP2 knockdown in TRP2-positive melanoma cells using three different shRNAs caused a target specific increase in p53 function nor did overexpression of TRP2 in a TRP2 negative melanoma cell line repress p53 expression. The discrepancy between our data and the one reported by Sendoel et al. could be due to the fact that different cell lines were used in the two studies. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the inhibitory effect of TRP2 on p53 described by Sendoel et al. is a cell line specific phenomenon. It is also known that different cell culture practices and cell culture conditions used in different laboratories can have a major influence on gene expression and consequently can lead to different experimental results <xref rid="pone.0087440-Eberle1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087440-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our data from cell culture experiments, however, are not only consistent between different cell lines and different shRNAs, but the conclusion derived from these experiments is also in line with our immunohistochemical studies. In summary our results suggest that TRP2 is not generally suppressing p53 in melanoma and that with respect to future therapeutic strategies the aforementioned proteins i.e. iASPP, p63 and MDMX appear to be more promising targets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Lena Voelkert and Claudia Siedel for technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0087440-Smalley1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Smalley</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Contractor</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haass</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kulp</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Atilla-Gokcumen</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2007</year>) <article-title>An organometallic protein kinase inhibitor pharmacologically activates p53 and induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells</article-title>. <source>Cancer Res</source><volume>67</volume>: <fpage>209</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>217</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17210701</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0087440-Soussi1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Soussi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Beroud</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name> (<year>2001</year>) <article-title>Assessing TP53 status in human tumours to evaluate clinical outcome</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Cancer</source><volume>1</volume>: <fpage>233</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>240</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11902578</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0087440-Sherr1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sherr</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name> (<year>2001</year>) <article-title>The INK4a/ARF network in tumour suppression</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol</source><volume>2</volume>: <fpage>731</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>737</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11584300</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0087440-Gembarska1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Gembarska A, Luciani F, Fedele C, Russell EA, Dewaele M, <etal>et al</etal>.
